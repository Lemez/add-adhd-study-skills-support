It's brilliant having sessions with you. It is quality control and accountability. Thanks also for playing devil's advocate this week: I had two people in each ear pulling me in opposite directions. It's important for me to have someone like that in my life. The questions you asked me really helped me to reflect and find out what I wanted more.
