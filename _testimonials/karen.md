I am completely on board with your views. I am so very grateful to you for all your help and advice. Your input has been fantastic. I wish you could have seen our son tonight, laughing and joshing with his brothers and their friends.

Please continue to work with us. He needs it, and I believe that you get real responses from him, rather than what he thinks we want to hear.
