Jonathan tutored our daughter in preparation for her AS exams in English, Biology and Geography.

He is an excellent tutor - he has the great capacity of creating confidence by supporting the student to engage in critical thinking, connecting a problem or question to their existing knowledge and then applying it with a solution oriented approach, as well as helping to analyse where they still have gaps and how to bridge them.

We also highly valued the way he supported our daughter to discover and develop precise study skills that matched her personality, and last but not least having the right amount of humour and lightness to take off the edge when the pressure and stress of the exam preparations were getting a bit too much.

Our daughter decided that Jonathan was one of the few adults that were worthy of respect... You know how teenagers can be I suppose! Oh yes, and the results ranged from very good to excellent."
