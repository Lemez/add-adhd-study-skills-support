## Why I love working with students
I believe that working together with a student one-on-one is the best form of education: completely personalised and centred around the individual. All learning should and can be enjoyable, but we all have different ways of learning.

The greatest pleasure in tutoring is to find out what makes a student’s eyes sparkle, what excites them, how to connect what they already know to the task in front of them. If we are motivated to do something and the experience itself is enjoyable, then the results come by themselves.

In my professional life in education, I have learnt a lot about studying techniques, how the brain processes information and how memory works, but I have come to the conclusion that there is something more fundamental that underpins successful learning: human relations.

Being a parent is a difficult job - we want our children to have opportunities that we didn’t have, and we worry about whether we are good enough to help them achieve their full potential. For me, the reward in being a tutor is to help parents to understand where their children’s talents are and how they can be harnessed. Ultimately we just want our children to be happy, and it is our job to make sure that education serves us towards achieving this goal, instead of getting in the way.

This early experience with learning difficulties and the extra confusion it can bring to families made me interested in working with special needs education and neurodiversity, the ways in which different brains have different talents and abilities.

I am also particularly interested in the human voice and hearing, as a result of years of work as a musician and a voice coach for singers and actors. For the last three years I have been lucky enough to work with Dr. Nigel Osborne, a pioneer in the field of music therapy and trauma.  I am a keen linguist and can get by in ten or so languages, and have conducted researched into language acquisition and loss. I created a sound-based method for teaching Tamil while living in South India.

In my earlier years after graduating, I was a professional musician working in film, dance and on stage (trumpet, composer, songwriter) for fifteen years, and then I spent five years running an education startup company, sponsored by the UK government's InnovateUK programme, making new products for EAL and primary school literacy.

My tutoring work is contracted through the Osborne Cawkwell agency.
