It's Boring - Paying Attention

We are wired to pay attention. Without attention we find ourselves in danger from the first bear or snake that came along.  So, to say that someone has an "attention disorder" is fundamentally incorrect. There is not a human being on earth who cannot pay attention when they need or want to.

Even children or adults with the most severe ADD will be able to pay attention extremely well in many parts of their lives. 

So what on earth are we talking about then?

Although I don't agree with the nomenclature of AD(H)D,  if we have to use it, we can add a few more words to the acronym to make it more meaningful. 

I prefer to think of ADDIBS: A D D in Boring Sitations.

Before too many people get upset, let's be clear what we mean by the word 'boring', and to do so we can use a viewpoint from another culture to reflect greater understanding back into our own language. Tamil, one of the oldest and most refined languages in all human culture, has no independent word for 'boring', or for that matter, 'interesting'. The concept, however, is used just as often. This is how they express it:

(Ennaku) pudikkum. It is pleasing (to me). I like it. It's interesting.
(Ennaku) pudikkathu. It is not pleasing (to me). I don't like it. It's boring.

In English, when we call something 'boring', people will immediately leap to the defence of thing being called boring, saying "But I love it" and "if you don't find that interesting, it's your problem." English (along with most Indo-European languages I know of)* give us highly problematic statements like "Maths is boring." The problem lies in the fact that the sentence purports to be objective, as if interestingness or boringness can ever be a property of something or someone, but in fact is just expressing a speaker's opinion. 

 In Tamil, however, you are forced to be subjective. 
 > **Kannuku pudkkathu** Maths is not pleasing (for me). 

Even when we add "I think that" or "in my opinion", we are still expressing what we believe to be an objective quality. "I think that Maths is boring" has a very different meaning to "I don't like Maths": the first is far more likely to induce an angry or defensive response.

And so, for the sake of clarity, when I talk about something being boring in English, I am always referring to is as a subjective opinion related to the speaker.

The concept of being boring or interesting is only acquired later in life, and it only exists in response to adults insisting on the question 'Why?'.

Every parent will recognise the exchange below:
Child: I don't like broccoli / (insert any other foodstuff).
Parent: Since when?
Child: Because I don't.
Parent: (protesting) Why not?
Child: It's disgusting.

Outcome: Parent gets upset or angry and child pushes food away

In this tiny exchange is information we can use better to understand how to support loved ones with mental health issues.

In the first sentence, the child tells the parent how they feel. For the parent, this information is not enough. They seek another reason above and beyond their own child's feelings. What is the message here? That the child's feelings are not enough, that the parent will not accept and listen to the child's feelings alone. And so the child is forced into an objective statement, which is only cute in this case is because it is so obviously a subjective opinion expressed as an objective truth. Later on life, this blurring of opinion and fact becomes much more subtle, and can bring with it much more serious miscommunication. The logic of "I don't like broccoli because it's disgusting" stays with us for life.

A different version of this conversation goes like this:
Child: I don't like broccoli.
Parent: You don't like the colour?
Child: No, not that.
Parent: Is it too squishy?
Child: Yes, I hate it.

Outcome: Next time parent cooks broccoli a few minutes less, and child happily eats it.

It is often pointless to ask the question why, or why not to a child. But grown-ups, it seems, never learn.

We hear this formulation a lot in school. I don't like this boy in my class - he's horrible. I don't like this subject - it's boring.

As we have seen with the broccoli, we can get much more insight by asking further questions by  


Nothing is objectively interesting or boring - Interestingness or boringness can only ever be subjective

What we can say, though, is that at moments when they should pay attention, they don't.

Why? Because something else is more interesting.

Monotony of sensory input is the cause of inattention.


Monotony of voice, monotony of dynamic, of visual


* There are other language groups, like Cherokee in North America, that give us this critical information about whether the speaker is talking subjectively or objectively by using different verb forms. Sometimes I think that if only English had developed to this level of sophistication, 90% of all our communciation problems would be solved in one fell swoop.
