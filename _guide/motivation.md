Like many aspects of ADHD, motivation is a paradox.

if someone is unmotivated


Goran Ivkic / neurologist
in rehabilitation therapy / motivation is everything
if a patient is not motivated, better they are not in rehabilitation, it will only make them more frustrated

If you take a tablet you are afraid of, it is a nocebo / it will cause harm
fears inhibit any intervention, even neurofeedback, or chemical




"V long talk about ADHD and management and motivation; three types of activity:
1.  tasks (chores), or things that other ppl want you to do (extrinsic motivations)
2. growth (anythign you want to do, or long term related intrinsic motivations)
3. presence (any random thing that flows and gives pleasure)

 ADHD ppl need at least one of 2 and 3 alongside 1 in order to be able to bear 1. Any activity or plan that does not have 2 / 3 baked into it is bound to fail.

Suggested that we need to radically change revision concept - I invited M to BP next week to work with me there. I also suggested his retreat in Catalunya but he prefers to go swh totally different"


Students with ADD are extremely sensitive, and resist attempts to get them to do things that they do not want to do. This most often comes along with things that they "have to" do. They often have great difficulty forcing themselves to carry out external tasks - like school work - and can leave everything until the last minute, when the anxiety becomes too much and they have no choice. This can be a very stressful pattern for everyone around: family, friends, the student themselves. 

In contrast, ADD students often report getting lost in tasks and activities that they choose. They can focus very well, but only on tasks that have some integral meaning. Anything that we choose to do ourselves has, by definition, meaning to us.

Every task that someone else gives us, it may or may not have meaning, and we have a choice whether to do it or not. Others' tasks are, by definition, not driven by intrinsic / internal motivation.  

And so as an external specialist "tutor / mentor", usually one who is brought in by parents and not by a student themselves,  I can teach activities and tasks and approaches, but the student might resist them. 

This results in a core paradox - how to bring about behavioural change in someone who is resistant to external ideas? 

The answer lies in the first A of ADD - attention.
