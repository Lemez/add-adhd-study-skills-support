parents issues

We have three other children and he takes up 75% of our attention, it's not fair on the others.
He is so selfish, wont put dishes away, leaves the kitchen a mess, so inconsiderate, whenever we ask him to do anything he gets upset and flounces away. Becoming unbearable.
We are all treading on eggshells around him.
Drinking every night, staying up til 6 in the morning on computer games.
I have to go in more than ten times to wake him up, it lasts hours. I want to get on with my day.

I cant help thinking we are overindulging and creating a problem

How will he ever cope by himself?

He has a choice to make, so he is choosing to be selfish.

 

Something has to change
