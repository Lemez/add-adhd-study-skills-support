My goal in working with your child is to get them to the point of being able to manage alone, without extra support from me or anyone else. 

I use a philosophy of care based on enjoyment, positivity and mutual respect. A fundamental part of this is that the student comes willingly to sessions, communicates regularly and keeps up attendance.

Depending on the situation, I can either work in a normal tutoring role, one-on-one with a student, or as part of an integrated care team, liaising with psychologists, psychiatrists and other health professionals.

Student mental health is often something that is best tackled by the family as a whole. This means that every child, no matter how old they are, needs their parents to work together with an external support like me to bring about long-lasting improvement. 

The main principles I work with are:

- Goal-oriented
	- together with the family, we identify a set of clear, tangible goals when we start working together. This gives us targets to compare ourselves against, which can be critical when faced with setbacks that can feel overwhelming. Progress over time is our key measure.
- Practical-oriented
	- sessions are focussed primarily on practical day-to-day ADHD management strategies, such as organising time, breaking down academic tasks into smaller chunks, sleep and waking up at the right time, dealing with communications, improving their study environment, diet and exercise, forward planning.
- Managing anxiety
	- I dedicate part of each session time to carry out together practical tasks that may cause anxiety, and would typically snowball into something more serious if not dealt with.
- Confidential
	- Students and parents have control over what information from sessions is and is not shared with each other, educators and professionals, in order to foster an ethical, trust-based relationship. However, I strongly discourage students keeping secrets (of the "please don't tell mum and dad" variety), and there are clear exceptions for any information which implies potential danger or personal risk 
- Family-based
	- we make a clear set of records of each session, and I communicate regularly with the family to ensure that we are on the right track, and to get feedback for how the student is outside of sessions
- Positive Nudging
	- creating a positive physical environment for the student that nudges them repeatedly to engage in small behaviours that help them on a daily basis
- Distraction Zapping 
	- being honest about what gets in the way, and helping students to remove those distractions from their work environment
- Positive decision-making
	- work to identify key strengths, look at future choices, and help guide the student in a direction that will minimise the difficulties of their condition
- Accountability
	- many ADD students find it difficult to concentrate when studying alone
	- It is easier to work when someone is with you, expecting you to deliver. ADD students are sensitive and carely deeply about not disappointing others. Accompanying someone through their work uses this secondary motivation - to please others - to achieve their primary goal, completing tasks on time
- Data-driven
	- I take extensive notes on mood, attendance, session contents and mental health issues, and feed that data back to students so that they can see their behavioural patterns over time, and use these insights to make better, data-driven decision rather than relying on a gut feeling that can lead to repeated disappointments
	- refine our approach regularly using an iterative trial and error process, backed by data, to understand what works and what doesn't

A word of warning here: learning strategies for managing ADD is a long process, and we have to expect there to be bumps in the road. ADD students often find themselves setting unrealistic expectations, which compounds feelings of low self-worth and frustration in the family. I work with families to break that pattern and find a collective strategy that works for the family unit as a whole. 

A mental health condition can be distressing for a family, and I understand that we are often in a hurry to see results. Data, in this case, is our friend - looking at behaviour patterns over time allows us to take a longer view, and measure progress over time.

Managing ADD requires a student to see for themselved how their habits and behaviours are connected, and key to the process is a student's own conscious desire to change. If your child is in an isolated place, such as boarding school or at University, I ask for a commitment to at least an initial three month period with two sessions weekly. This is in order to have enough time to work with them to implement strategies that will help them to manage their ADD by themselves.
