The roots of ADD are related to attention. A child's experience in a key neural developmental stage was that, for whatever reason, they lacked attention or safety. There are multiple potential reasons within a family that this can be felt: household tensions,  moving countries, separation from carers and friends (eg boarding school) etc. Therefore the real need that ADD tutoring / mentoring addresses is this need for attention, as provided in a caring mentoring framework, and it is this attention that is the key to enabling anyone with ADD to focus on an external, or "have-to" task. This is the second D of ADD - the Deficit. The job of a supporting someone with ADD is therefore to address their Attention Deficit.  

The work has the best outcomes - and is the most rewarding - when it consists of personalised attention. In order for this attention to be meaningful, at the start, I need to understand what a student wants and enjoys deep down. This leads to understanding how to personalise our sessions, what they do and don't enjoy. That involves an initial "getting to know you" process which is important for long-term succes. It means doing activities together that bring real value to the student - using their real interests and desires.

For example, one of my students wants to be a writer, and when his motivation is down, we do creative writing together. This has the effect of kickstarting him out of a negative or depressed mood, and allows us to work in a focussed way for the rest of the session.

In order for the process to give real value, the mentoring relationship relies on a trusting, personal connection. If, for any reason, that connection does not materialise, I would recommend that parents find a different mentor.
