While making this website, I asked one of my former students to describe how I work and what I do. Here is what he said:

> Most people working with ADHD, doctors or psychologists or whoever, look at it like an engineer - this is how ADHD works, and they give you techniques and a manual to read. "If you do this and that, then it will go away." But ADHD isn't lived like this. 
>
Your thing is that you look at the human part. What is ADHD? How can you separate it from how a person is made, from their character, from their being? 
>
Most people start with the assumption that this person has a cold that makes them cough, and asks what can we give them to suppress the cough.
>
Your perspective is a far more human one, not about 'dealing with it' or 'mitigating it' but accepting it and seeing what life looks like afterwards. 'Dealing with ADHD' doesn't have to mean getting treatment or drugs or whatever and changing yourself to be different to who you are - it can also mean accepting who you are, and making your life going forwards from this point.
>
So you help people to find ways to tailor their life to themselves. It could be as simple as motivation, hanging out, understanding that this person needs meaning from social interaction in order to get things done that have no inherent meaning. That a process can give something meaning.
>
Instead of trying to change the person, you start with the person, and then understand what is good for them, rather than the other way round. It is about accepting the person. The dissonance in the families is that the parents - and by extension the kids themselves - don't accept the kids how they truly are.
>
You accept that ADHD is not an illness, but a way of being. The term ADHD is part of the problem - if we label it a disorder, then it is a problem to be righted. But you come in and shift the paradigm. I remember one of the first conversations that we had, you said: "What if we change the way we look at this?"
>
Parents are [wrongly] clear about what is and what is not, and this contaminates the kid. So they put them in therapy and treatment. Realistically, therapy can't change someone's ADHD any more than it can change someone's sexuality. For a long time, we thought that 'disordered' sexuality could be removed from someone through therapy. Now we understand that it is an inherent part of who they are. 
>
You have made me look at it differently: I am the way I am, and now that I accept this, I know how it is that I am going to do the things I want, I know more clearly what to ask of myself. Lots of times with ADHD, the kid doesn't know what to ask of themselves, as parents mould that for you: an idea of yourself that is inherited or learnt from them. If the kids could do the thing that is in their heart, there woud be no ADHD or ADHD performance issues.
>
You see ADHD as people who require a concrete and personal sense of meaning in the things they do. It is a very subjective meaningfulness. Some people just can't do things that don't mean anything to them. Perhaps other people can find meaning outside of themselves, which is why they end up doing jobs or making decisions that they hate. There are different sources of meaningfulness, for example someone who is into getting rich can get meaning from that achieving that goal, but if for you it doesn't have meaning, then there's nothing you can do to get that meaning, and you have to pursue something else.
>
<!-- If I was a mentor, I would first ask parents to think of the most useless activity they can imagine, and then ask them how they would feel if they would have to do that thing. That is what ADHD is like. Maybe they dont conceptualise it as useless, but thats the experience of having ADHD.
