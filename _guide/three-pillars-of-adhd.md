How To Help - Acceptance
How to Help - Tension (between expectations, between cause and effect, between different concepts of time)
1. Acceptance

ADHD as a phenomenon can be understood as a difference between:
- a) how someone behaves
- b) how others expect them to behave

Within this inherent tension are many of the issues necessary to an appreciation of what ADHD is, and how to help.

The name itself, ADHD, puts all the stress of resolution on the person themselves. By calling it a disorder, it is understood to be a pyschological problem that can be cured. This is both a dangerous misconception and a fundamentally useless approach.

So the first place to start is to rid yourself of the concept that there is something wrong with the person you love who has ADHD. Rather than framing it as a disorder, it is much more helpful to understand it as the way in which their brain has developed during childhood. There is nothing wrong with them. What is wrong, however, is the stress that this puts on relationships: how their effects of their ADHD impact on their image of self and on their close relationships. Only by stopping an expectation of someone 'pulling themselves together' or 'trying harder', can we begin to accept them as they are and finding lasting solutions to the secondary social problems that often blight the lives of people with ADHD.

Even though it can be very hard for those around them to understand, the symptoms of ADHD that drive their loved ones crazy **make sense** to them at the time. Being late, missing meetings, leaving everything to the last minute - these are all the result of things that make perfect sense to an ADHD brain.
