I have been involved in education for twenty years, and have a wide range of experience in different subjects - as a student, a practitioner and a tutor.

## Specialist Mentoring
As a mentor, I work with students to help them make better decisions. Young people often come to me in a state of conflict - unsure as to what they want, torn between differing expectations, feeling alone. They often feel that they do not fit in, and that they need to change.

My work is focussed on enabling them to appreciate themselves, to gain confidence in their abilities and to imagine a future crafted around what they have to offer.

In recent years I have worked intensively in the following areas:

- Study Skills, Language Learning and Memory Techniques
- ADD / ADHD
- Trauma and Post Traumatic Stress
- Autism
- Mental Health

## Subjects
I am open to helping students in any subject, as the vast majority of tutoring work does not require specialist subject expertise, but rather helping students to study more efficiently and organise what they do and don't know.

Here is a list of subjects I have tutored in recent years:

- Academic Development, Interview Technique & Essay Writing (all levels)
- Anthropology (Degree level)
- Aviation (Commercial Helicopter Pilot Licence)
- Biology (AS-Level)
- Business Studies (Degree level)
- Creative Writing (Degree level)

## Why I love working with students
I believe that working together with a student one-on-one is the best form of education: completely personalised and centred around the individual. All learning should and can be enjoyable, and we all have different ways of learning. The greatest pleasure in tutoring is to find out what makes a student’s eyes sparkle, what excites them, how to connect what they already know to the task in front of them. If we are motivated to do something and the experience itself is enjoyable, then the results come by themselves.

In my professional life in education, I have learnt a lot about studying techniques, how the brain processes information and how memory works, but I have come to the conclusion that there is something more fundamental that underpins successful learning: human relations.

Being a parent is a difficult job - we want our children to have opportunities that we didn’t have, and we worry about whether we are good enough to help them achieve their full potential. For me, the reward in being a tutor is to help parents to understand where their children’s talents are and how they can be harnessed. Ultimately we just want our children to be happy, and it is our job to make sure that education serves us towards achieving this goal, instead of getting in the way.

I am a passionate advocate of neurodiversity, the ways in which our brains develop with differing talents and abilities. We are all unique, which is why one-on-one work is so rewarding. Helping a student to see and appreciate their own talent and possibilties, sometimes after long periods of being shamed at school, is one of the greatest rewards a teacher can have.
